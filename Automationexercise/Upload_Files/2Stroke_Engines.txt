 
Q. Why 2 Stroke Engines are Banned in India ?

	two-stroke engines are not entirely banned in India, but their use has been restricted in certain applications due to environmental concerns. Here are some reasons why two-stroke engines face restrictions:

High Pollution: Two-stroke engines tend to produce higher levels of pollution compared to four-stroke engines. This is primarily due to the fact that they burn a mixture of oil and fuel, resulting in incomplete combustion and higher emissions of hydrocarbons (HC) and particulate matter (PM). These emissions contribute to air pollution, which can have adverse effects on public health and the environment.
Emission Regulations: In recent years, governments around the world, including India, have implemented stricter emission regulations to combat air pollution and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulations often set limits on the amount of pollutants that vehicles can emit. Two-stroke engines typically struggle to meet these stringent emission standards without additional emissions control technologies, which can increase their cost and complexity.
Health Concerns: The pollutants emitted by two-stroke engines, such as hydrocarbons and particulate matter, can have harmful effects on human health, particularly respiratory problems. This is a significant concern, especially in densely populated urban areas where vehicle emissions can contribute significantly to air quality deterioration.
Fuel Efficiency: Two-stroke engines are generally less fuel-efficient than four-stroke engines, as they tend to waste some of the fuel-air mixture during the intake and exhaust strokes. With the increasing focus on fuel efficiency and reducing dependence on fossil fuels, there has been a shift towards promoting more efficient and cleaner technologies, such as four-stroke engines and electric vehicles.
While two-stroke engines are not entirely banned in India, their use has been restricted in certain applications, such as motorcycles and auto-rickshaws. Many Indian cities have implemented regulations to phase out older, more polluting vehicles, including those equipped with two-stroke engines, in favor of newer, cleaner alternatives. Additionally, the Indian government has been promoting the adoption of cleaner technologies and alternative fuels to reduce vehicle emissions and improve air quality.
